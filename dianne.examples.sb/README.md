# State Belief

This example runs and visualizes a state belief model using the Kuka Youbot environments in DIANNE.

To run the example, launch the .bndrun file and direct your browser to `<your-url>:8080/example/sb/index.html`

To use the VREP simulator, we recommend building and running inside the dianne-kuka docker container that can be built from the DIANNE source tree.

On the real kuka, export and run the `sb.real.bndrun` configuration together with all `.config` files.
